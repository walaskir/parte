## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Code Quality Checks

**ALWAYS run the following commands before completing any task:**

Automatically use the IDE's built-in diagnostics tool to check for linting and type errors:

- Run `mcp__ide__getDiagnostics` to check all files for diagnostics
- Fix any linting or type errors before considering the task complete
- Do this for any file you create or modify

This is a CRITICAL step that must NEVER be skipped when working on any code-related task.
